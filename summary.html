              Yasuke was born into a secret clan of powerful warriors that possessed the power to generate electric pulses from their hands. This clan was called the legendary Asakura clan. This power was infused with the use of their Samurai swords. This meant they could send electric pulses through their sword as they were charged up. The Asakura clan has used all their powers to protect and serve the Kamakura Dynasty.

            The Kamakura Dynasty was the first dynasty of rulers that loved and served all the people of the land of Higashi. When there is a good force in the world, there will also be an evil force that wants to destroy all good. In this story, it was the Yakuza clan. The Yakuza clan, who were a set of revolutionists and anarchists who wanted something different from the Asakura clan and wanted to overtake the current people in charge.

            The Yakuza knew if they were to take control, they had to take out the people strong enough to stop them, the people of the Asakura clan. They were a power hungry people who wanted to seize power in any way possible. For hundreds of years they have been trying to wreak havoc on the land of Higashi and destroy the Kamakura Dynasty, but they could never even touch the Kamakuras because of the protection of the Asakura clan.

            The Yakuza clan wiped out the Asakura clan in a secret ambush using banished powers from the dungeon of the dead in order to take away the strength of the Kamakura dynasty, but Yasuke who was a toddler at the time was hidden by his mother as the attacks started. The Yakuza left thinking that all the members of the Asakura clan were killed, but there was one remaining. Yasuke ran to the Kamakura palace and he was taken in by Emperor Fumi.
